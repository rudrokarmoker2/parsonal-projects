                <h1 class="about-7">Poetry  </h1>
                Internationally, Gitanjali (Bengali: ‡¶ó‡ßÄ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶û‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶≤‡¶ø) is Tagore's best-known collection of poetry, for which
                he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. Tagore was the first non-European to receive a
                Nobel Prize in Literature and the second non-European to receive a Nobel Prize after Theodore
                Roosevelt.[119]

                Besides Gitanjali, other notable works include Manasi, Sonar Tori ("Golden Boat"), Balaka ("Wild Geese"
                ‚Äì the title being a metaphor for migrating souls)[120]

                Tagore's poetic style, which proceeds from a lineage established by 15th- and 16th-century Vaishnava
                poets, ranges from classical formalism to the comic, visionary, and ecstatic. He was influenced by the
                atavistic mysticism of Vyasa and other rishi-authors of the Upanishads, the Bhakti-Sufi mystic Kabir,
                and Ramprasad Sen.[121] Tagore's most innovative and mature poetry embodies his exposure to Bengali
                rural folk music, which included mystic Baul ballads such as those of the bard Lalon.[122][123] These,
                rediscovered and re-popularized by Tagore, resemble 19th-century KartƒÅbhajƒÅ hymns that emphasize inward
                divinity and rebellion against bourgeois bhadralok religious and social orthodoxy.[124][125] During his
                Shelaidaha years, his poems took on a lyrical voice of the moner manush, the BƒÅuls' "man within the
                heart" and Tagore's "life force of his deep recesses", or meditating upon the jeevan devata‚Äîthe demiurge
                or the "living God within".[22] This figure connected with divinity through appeal to nature and the
                emotional interplay of human drama. Such tools saw use in his BhƒÅnusi·πÉha poems chronicling the
                Radha-Krishna romance, which were repeatedly revised over seventy years.[126][127]

                Later, with the development of new poetic ideas in Bengal ‚Äì many originating from younger poets seeking
                to break with Tagore's style ‚Äì Tagore absorbed new poetic concepts, which allowed him to further develop
                a unique identity. Examples of this include Africa and Camalia, which are among the better-known of his
                latter poems. <br><br><br><br><br><hr> <br>
                
                <h1 class="about-7"> Songs </h1>
                
                <br><br>

                
                    Tagore was a prolific composer, with around 2,230 songs to his credit.[128] His songs are known as
                    rabindrasangit ("Tagore Song"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which‚Äîpoems or
                    parts of novels, stories, or plays alike‚Äîwere lyricized. Influenced by the thumri style of
                    Hindustani music, they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like
                    Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions.[129] They emulated the tonal color of
                    classical ragas to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully,
                    others newly blended elements of different ragas.[130] Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not
                    bhanga gaan, the body of tunes revamped with "fresh value" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali
                    folk and other regional flavors "external" to Tagore's own ancestral culture.[22]

                    Rabindranath Tagore reciting Jana Gana Mana
                    In 1971, Amar Shonar Bangla became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written ‚Äì ironically ‚Äì
                    to protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal along communal lines: cutting off the Muslim-majority East
                    Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition
                    as a cunning plan to stop the independence movement, and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar
                    communalism. Jana Gana Mana was written in shadhu-bhasha, a Sanskritised form of Bengali,[131] and
                    is the first of five stanzas of the Brahmo hymn Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata that Tagore composed. It was
                    first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress,[132] and was adopted in
                    1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.

                    Sri Lanka's National Anthem was inspired by his work.[18]

                    For Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty
                    described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the Modern Review observed that "[t]here
                    is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be
                    sung... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs".[133] Tagore influenced sitar maestro Vilayat Khan
                    and sarodiyas Buddhadev Dasgupta and Amjad Ali Khan.[130]

                <div class="about-2">
                    <h1 class="about-1">Works </h1>
                    Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, and
                    thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps the most highly regarded; he is
                    indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently
                    noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. Such stories mostly borrow from the lives
                    of common people. Tagore's non-fiction grappled with history, linguistics, and spirituality. He
                    wrote autobiographies. His travelogues, essays, and lectures were compiled into several volumes,
                    including Europe Jatrir Patro (Letters from Europe) and Manusher Dhormo (The Religion of Man). His
                    brief chat with Einstein, "Note on the Nature of Reality", is included as an appendix to the latter.
                    On the occasion of Tagore's 150th birthday, an anthology (titled Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali)
                    of the total body of his works is currently being published in Bengali in chronological order. This
                    includes all versions of each work and fills about eighty volumes.[105] In 2011, Harvard University
                    Press collaborated with Visva-Bharati University to publish The Essential Tagore, the largest
                    anthology of Tagore's works available in English; it was edited by Fakrul Alam and Radha
                    Chakravarthy and marks the 150th anniversary of Tagore's birth.[106]

                    <h1 class="about-3">Drama </h1>
                    Tagore's experiences with drama began when he was sixteen, with his brother Jyotirindranath. He
                    wrote his first original dramatic piece when he was twenty ‚Äì Valmiki Pratibha which was shown at the
                    Tagore's mansion. Tagore stated that his works sought to articulate "the play of feeling and not of
                    action". In 1890 he wrote Visarjan (an adaptation of his novella Rajarshi), which has been regarded
                    as his finest drama. In the original Bengali language, such works included intricate subplots and
                    extended monologues. Later, Tagore's dramas used more philosophical and allegorical themes. The play
                    Dak Ghar (The Post Office; 1912), describes the child Amal defying his stuffy and puerile confines
                    by ultimately "fall[ing] asleep", hinting his physical death. A story with borderless
                    appeal‚Äîgleaning rave reviews in Europe‚ÄîDak Ghar dealt with death as, in Tagore's words, "spiritual
                    freedom" from "the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds".[107][108] Another is Tagore's
                    Chandalika (Untouchable Girl), which was modelled on an ancient Buddhist legend describing how
                    Ananda, the Gautama Buddha's disciple, asks a tribal girl for water.[109] In Raktakarabi ("Red" or
                    "Blood Oleanders") is an allegorical struggle against a kleptocrat king who rules over the residents
                    of Yaksha puri.[110]

                <div class="about-6">
                    <h1 class="about-5">Novels </h1>
                    Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them Nastanirh (1901), Noukadubi (1906),
                    Chaturanga (1916) and Char Adhyay (1934).

                    In Chokher Bali (1902‚Äì1903), Tagore inscribes Bengali society via its heroine: a rebellious widow
                    who would live for herself alone. He pillories the custom of perpetual mourning on the part of
                    widows, who were not allowed to remarry, who were consigned to seclusion and loneliness.

                    Ghare Baire (The Home and the World, 1916), through the lens of the idealistic zamindar protagonist
                    Nikhil, excoriates rising Indian nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the Swadeshi
                    movement; a frank expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it emerged from a 1914 bout of
                    depression. The novel ends in Hindu-Muslim violence and Nikhil's likely mortal‚Äîwounding.[115]

                    His longest novel, Gora (1907‚Äì1910), raises controversial questions regarding the Indian identity.
                    As with Ghare Baire, matters of self-identity (jƒÅti), personal freedom, and religion are developed
                    in the context of a family story and love triangle.[116] In it, an Irish boy orphaned in the Sepoy
                    Mutiny is raised by Hindus as the titular gora‚Äî"whitey". Ignorant of his foreign origins, he
                    chastises Hindu religious backsliders out of love for the indigenous Indians and solidarity with
                    them against his hegemon-compatriots. He falls for a Brahmo girl, compelling his worried foster
                    father to reveal his lost past and cease his nativist zeal. As a "true dialectic" advancing
                    "arguments for and against strict traditionalism", it tackles the colonial conundrum by
                    "portray[ing] the value of all positions within a particular frame [...] not only syncretism, not
                    only liberal orthodoxy but the extremist reactionary traditionalism he defends by an appeal to what
                    humans share." Among these, Tagore highlights "identity [...] conceived of as dharma."[117]

                    In Jogajog (Yogayog, Relationships, 1929), the heroine Kumudini‚Äîbound by the ideals of ≈öiva-Sati,
                    exemplified by DƒÅkshƒÅyani‚Äîis torn between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and
                    compassionate elder brother and his foil: her rou√© of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist
                    leanings; pathos depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and
                    family honor; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry.[118] The story
                    revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families‚Äîthe Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the
                    decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini,
                    Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an
                    observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.

                    Others were uplifting: Shesher Kabita (1929) ‚Äî translated twice as Last Poem and Farewell Song ‚Äî is
                    his most lyrical novel, with poems and rhythmic passages written by a poet protagonist. It contains
                    elements of satire and postmodernism and has stock characters who gleefully attack the reputation of
                    an old, outmoded, oppressively renowned poet who, incidentally, goes by a familiar name:
                    "Rabindranath Tagore".

                    Though his novels remain among the least-appreciated of his works, they have been given renewed
                    attention via film adaptations, by Satyajit Ray for Charulata (based on Nastanirh) in 1964 and Ghare
                    Baire in 1984, and by several others filmmakers such as Satu Sen for Chokher Bali already in 1938,
                    when Tagore was still alive.
