                    Tagore opposed imperialism and supported Indian nationalists,[141][142][143] and these views were
                    first revealed in Manast, which was mostly composed in his twenties.[52] Evidence produced during
                    the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial and latter accounts affirm his awareness of the Ghadarites and
                    stated that he sought the support of Japanese Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake and former Premier
                    ≈åkuma Shigenobu.[144] Yet he lampooned the Swadeshi movement; he rebuked it in The Cult of the
                    Charkha, an acrid 1925 essay.[145] According to Amartya Sen, Tagore rebelled against strongly
                    nationalist forms of the independence movement, and he wanted to assert India's right to be
                    independent without denying the importance of what India could learn from abroad.[146] He urged the
                    masses to avoid victimology and instead seek self-help and education, and he saw the presence of
                    British administration as a "political symptom of our social disease". He maintained that, even for
                    those at the extremes of poverty, "there can be no question of blind revolution"; preferable to it
                    was a "steady and purposeful education".[147][148]

                    So I repeat we never can have a true view of man unless we have a love for him. Civilisation must be
                    judged and prized, not by the amount of power it has developed, but by how much it has evolved and
                    given expression to, by its laws and institutions, the love of humanity.

                    ‚Äî SƒÅdhanƒÅ: The Realisation of Life, 1916.[149]
                    Such views enraged many. He escaped assassination‚Äîand only narrowly‚Äîby Indian expatriates during his
                    stay in a San Francisco hotel in late 1916; the plot failed when his would-be assassins fell into an
                    argument.[150] Tagore wrote songs lionizing the Indian independence movement.[151] Two of Tagore's
                    more politically charged compositions, "Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo" ("Where the Mind is Without Fear")
                    and "Ekla Chalo Re" ("If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone"), gained mass appeal, with the
                    latter favored by Gandhi.[152] Though somewhat critical of Gandhian activism,[153] Tagore was key in
                    resolving a Gandhi‚ÄìAmbedkar dispute involving separate electorates for untouchables, thereby mooting
                    at least one of Gandhi's fasts "unto death".[154][155]

                    Repudiation of knighthood
                    See also: List of people who have declined a British honour ¬ß Renouncing an honour
                    Tagore renounced his knighthood in response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919. In the
                    repudiation letter to the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, he wrote[156]

                    The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of
                    humiliation, and I for my part, wish to stand, shorn, of all special distinctions, by the side of
                    those of my countrymen who, for their so-called insignificance, are liable to suffer degradation not
                    fit for human beings.

                    Santiniketan and Visva-Bharati

                    Kala Bhavan (Institute of Fine Arts), Santiniketan, India
                    Tagore despised rote classroom schooling, as shown in his short story, "The Parrot's Training",
                    wherein a bird is caged and force-fed textbook pages‚Äîto death.[157][158] Visiting Santa Barbara in
                    1917, Tagore conceived a new type of university: he sought to "make Santiniketan the connecting
                    thread between India and the world [and] a world center for the study of humanity somewhere beyond
                    the limits of nation and geography."[150] The school, which he named Visva-Bharati,[d] had its
                    foundation stone laid on 24 December 1918 and was inaugurated precisely three years later.[159]
                    Tagore employed a brahmacharya system: gurus gave pupils personal guidance‚Äîemotional, intellectual,
                    and spiritual. Teaching was often done under trees. He staffed the school, he contributed his Nobel
                    Prize monies,[160] and his duties as steward-mentor at Santiniketan kept him busy: mornings he
                    taught classes; afternoons and evenings he wrote the students' textbooks.[161] He fundraised widely
                    for the school in Europe and the United States between 1919 and 1921.[162]

                    Theft of Nobel Prize
                    On 25 March 2004, Tagore's Nobel Prize was stolen from the safety vault of the Visva-Bharati
                    University, along with several other of his belongings.[163] On 7 December 2004, the Swedish Academy
                    decided to present two replicas of Tagore's Nobel Prize, one made of gold and the other made of
                    bronze, to the Visva-Bharati University.[164] It inspired the fictional film Nobel Chor. In 2016, a
                    baul singer named Pradip Bauri, accused of sheltering the thieves, was arrested.
