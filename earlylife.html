                    The youngest of 13 surviving children, Tagore (nicknamed "Rabi") was born on 7 May 1861 in the
                    Jorasanko
                    mansion in Calcutta,[23] the son of Debendranath Tagore (1817‚Äì1905) and Sarada Devi (1830‚Äì1875).[b]

                    supporting a vase and flowing leaves.
                    Tagore and his wife Mrinalini Devi, 1883
                    Tagore was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early childhood, and his father
                    travelled widely.[29] The Tagore family was at the forefront of the Bengal renaissance. They hosted
                    the
                    publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music
                    featured
                    there regularly. Tagore's father invited several professional Dhrupad musicians to stay in the house
                    and
                    teach Indian classical music to the children.[30] Tagore's oldest brother Dwijendranath was a
                    philosopher and poet. Another brother, Satyendranath, was the first Indian appointed to the elite
                    and
                    formerly all-European Indian Civil Service. Yet another brother, Jyotirindranath, was a musician,
                    composer, and playwright.[31] His sister Swarnakumari became a novelist.[32] Jyotirindranath's wife
                    Kadambari Devi, slightly older than Tagore, was a dear friend and powerful influence. Her abrupt
                    suicide
                    in 1884, soon after he married, left him profoundly distraught for years.[33]

                    Tagore largely avoided classroom schooling and preferred to roam the manor or nearby Bolpur and
                    Panihati, which the family visited.[34][35] His brother Hemendranath tutored and physically
                    conditioned
                    him‚Äîby having him swim the Ganges or trek through hills, by gymnastics, and by practising judo and
                    wrestling. He learned drawing, anatomy, geography and history, literature, mathematics, Sanskrit,
                    and
                    English‚Äîhis least favourite subject.[36] Tagore loathed formal education‚Äîhis scholarly travails at
                    the
                    local Presidency College spanned a single day. Years later, he held that proper teaching does not
                    explain things; proper teaching stokes curiosity.[37]

                    After his upanayan (coming-of-age rite) at age eleven, Tagore and his father left Calcutta in
                    February
                    1873 to tour India for several months, visiting his father's Santiniketan estate and Amritsar before
                    reaching the Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie. There Tagore read biographies, studied history,
                    astronomy, modern science, and Sanskrit, and examined the classical poetry of KƒÅlidƒÅsa.[38][39]
                    During
                    his 1-month stay at Amritsar in 1873 he was greatly influenced by melodious gurbani and Nanak bani
                    being
                    sung at Golden Temple, for which both father and son were regular visitors. He writes in his My
                    Reminiscences (1912):

                    The golden temple of Amritsar comes back to me like a dream. Many a morning have I accompanied my
                    father
                    to this Gurudarbar of the Sikhs in the middle of the lake. There the sacred chanting resounds
                    continually. My father, seated amidst the throng of worshippers, would sometimes add his voice to
                    the
                    hymn of praise, and finding a stranger joining in their devotions they would wax enthusiastically
                    cordial, and we would return loaded with the sanctified offerings of sugar crystals and other
                    sweets.[40]

                    He wrote 6 poems relating to Sikhism and several articles in Bengali children's magazine about
                    Sikhism.[41]

                    Poems on Guru Gobind Singh: ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶´‡¶≤ ‡¶â‡¶™‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ Nishfal-upahaar (1888, translated as "Futile Gift"), ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßÅ
                    ‡¶ó‡ßã‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶ Guru Gobinda (1899) and ‡¶∂‡ßá‡¶∑ ‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ Shesh Shiksha (1899, translated as "Last Teachings")[41]
                    Poem on Banda Bahadur: ‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßÄ ‡¶¨‡ßÄ‡¶∞ Bandi-bir (The Prisoner Warrior, written in 1888 or 1898)[41]
                    Poem on Bhai Torusingh: ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶•‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶§‡ßÄ‡¶§ ‡¶¶‡¶æ‡¶® (prarthonatit dan ‚Äì Unsolicited gift) written in 1888 or
                    1898[41]
                    Poem on Nehal Singh: ‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶≤ ‡¶∏‡¶ø‡¶Ç‡¶π (Nihal Singh) written in 1935.[41]
                    Tagore returned to Jorosanko and completed a set of major works by 1877, one of them a long poem in
                    the
                    Maithili style of Vidyapati. As a joke, he claimed that these were the lost works of newly
                    discovered
                    17th-century Vai·π£·πáava poet BhƒÅnusi·πÉha.[42] Regional experts accepted them as the lost works of the
                    fictitious poet.[43] He debuted in the short-story genre in Bengali with "Bhikharini" ("The Beggar
                    Woman").[44][45] Published in the same year, Sandhya Sangit (1882) includes the poem "Nirjharer
                    Swapnabhanga" ("The Rousing of the Waterfall").
