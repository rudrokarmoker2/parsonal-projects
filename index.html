       Rabindranath Thakur  anglicised as Rabindranath Tagore 
      was a Bengali polymath who worked as a poet, writer, playwright,
      composer, philosopher, social reformer, and painter of the Bengal Renaissance. He reshaped Bengali
      literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He
      was the author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali. In 1913, Tagore became
      the first non-European to win a Nobel Prize in any category, and also the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in
      Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical
      poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent. He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred
      to as "the Bard of Bengal", Tagore was known by the sobriquets Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.

      A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote
      poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the
      pseudonym BhƒÅnusi·πÉha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By
      1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist,
      universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,[15] he denounced the British Raj and advocated
      independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised
      paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in his
      founding of Visva-Bharati University.

      Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels,
      stories, songs, dance dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora
      (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and
      novels were acclaimed‚Äîor panned‚Äîfor their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His
      compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's "Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar
      Shonar Bangla". The Sri Lankan national anthem was also inspired by his work.[18] His song "Banglar Mati Banglar
      Jol" has been adopted as the state anthem of West Bengal.</div>
